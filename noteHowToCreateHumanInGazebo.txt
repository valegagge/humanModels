November 2018 - Valentina Gaggero

1) I installed MakeHuman 1.1.1 on Windows, because on Ubuntu 18.04 it has a bug, that has been fixed, but the patch is not available in current release.
2) I installed blender 2.79 (windows)

3) I followed the instruction in this tutorial:
http://www.theconstructsim.com/create-spawn-humans-gazebo7/

The main points to remember are the following:
1) when create a new person, please select LOW_POLY eyes: in the model there is not many difference but it is better for face recognition
2) the skeleton it is not necessary (tab pose->skeleton)
If you want you can save Makehuman project. file .mhm extension
3) export in COLLADA (.dae) and be sure to use scale units is meters (panel on the left). 
    In the selected folder are generated .dae file and a folder called texture with .png file for body part.
4) export Lightmap in the same location.
   In the selected folder is created .png file 
5) export UV map in the same location

Now use blender
1) import->collada. be sure to select import units check on left panel
2) add light environment
3) render
4) if you see transparencies please activate alpha: select part-> texture icon -> materials icon -> alpha checkbox
5) put center of mass i the feet. object-> transform -> origin to 3d cursor
6) export collada file: be sure to select Materials in texture option on left panel and check copy.

7) Modify the dae file in this way:
   from : 
       <ambient>
          <color sid="ambient">0 0 0 1</color>
        </ambient>
    to

        <ambient>
          <color sid="ambient">1 1 1 1</color>
        </ambient>
        
8) update $GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH environment vaiable with the path to the folder where the sdf and dae files are.
